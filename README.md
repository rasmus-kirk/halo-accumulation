# Halo Accumulation Scheme Implementation

This repository contains a Rust implementation of the accumulation scheme
from the described in the 2020 paper _"Proof-Carrying Data from Accumulation
Schemes"_ by Benedikt BÃ¼nz, Alessandro Chiesa, Pratyush Mishra, and Nicholas
Spooner. The implementation is mostly written to broaden my own understanding
on the subject of IVC, and should be in no way considered secure or efficient.

## Overview

An accumulation scheme is a cryptographic construct used to "aggregate"
the verification of multiple proofs or statements into a single succinct
proof. The idea is to replace repeated verification of individual proofs with a
more efficient process, where the accumulated proof can be verified succinctly.

Key Objects:
- `Instance`: Generally a claim of some statement encoded in a polynomial commitment scheme.
- `Accumulator`: The central object in the scheme that aggregates information about the verified proofs.

Key Operations:
- `prover`: A process that integrates a new proof or statement into the accumulator.
- `verifier`: Verifies that the prover correctly accumulated the instance `q`, the old accumulator `acc` into the new accumulator `acc*`.
- `decider`: Given that _all_ previous accumulators have been correctly checked using the `verifier`, perform an expensive check.

With the correct runtime bounds, we can construct PCD (Proof-Carrying Data)
and IVC (Incrementally Verifiable Computation).
